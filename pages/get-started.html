<h2>NeuroTechX implication / relationship</h2>

<div class="medium-6 columns">
  <p>The student clubs are independant and have their own administrative structure, according to their university rules & standards. NeuroTechX does not have any governance nor authority over the club.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX is an international entity putting a framework around neurotechnology student clubs. Most universities won’t finance a student club it they are the only one alike on the planet. We help student clubs point a finger at us showing that it exists and more and more universities have their neurotech student clubs and yours should too.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX organizes one or more annual competition, either online or physical in a specific location and we strongly encourage all the student clubs part of the network to participate. You can find more information about the competition here.</p>
</div>

<div class="medium-6 columns">
  <p>NeuroTechX acts as a partner/sponsor. And should be displayed as such on your student club marketing material (website, swag merchandise, banners, etc.) You can find NeuroTechX marketing assets here or in the shared G-Drive folder.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX can help student clubs by donating devices (e.g. Neurosky, Muse Headband, OpenBCI Boards, etc.) this is at the discretion of NeuroTechX Student Club Committee.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX will feature your student club on its website and give you as much visibility as possible. (e.g. share your events, your projects, etc.)</p>

  <p>The student clubs should buy their devices from NeuroTechX Store (work in progress). The devices are the same price or less and NeuroTechX gets money from it. 2 birds 1 stone.</p>

  <p>We are working with our partners to get a discount code for NeuroTechX Student Clubs should be available soon.</p>

<h2>Activities</h2>
  <p>What kind of activities should the student club organize and/or engage in? It will obviously depend on the student club itself, its members and the kind of university and ecosystem they are in. Some might be more technical, some might do more events than others.</p>
