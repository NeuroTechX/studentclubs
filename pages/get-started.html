<h2>NeuroTechX implication / relationship</h2>

<div class="medium-6 columns">
  <p>The student clubs are independant and have their own administrative structure, according to their university rules & standards. NeuroTechX does not have any governance nor authority over the club.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX is an international entity putting a framework around neurotechnology student clubs. Most universities won’t finance a student club it they are the only one alike on the planet. We help student clubs point a finger at us showing that it exists and more and more universities have their neurotech student clubs and yours should too.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX organizes one or more annual competition, either online or physical in a specific location and we strongly encourage all the student clubs part of the network to participate. You can find more information about the competition here.</p>
</div>

<div class="medium-6 columns">
  <p>NeuroTechX acts as a partner/sponsor. And should be displayed as such on your student club marketing material (website, swag merchandise, banners, etc.) You can find NeuroTechX marketing assets here or in the shared G-Drive folder.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX can help student clubs by donating devices (e.g. Neurosky, Muse Headband, OpenBCI Boards, etc.) this is at the discretion of NeuroTechX Student Club Committee.</p>

  <p>NeuroTechX will feature your student club on its website and give you as much visibility as possible. (e.g. share your events, your projects, etc.)</p>

  <p>The student clubs should buy their devices from NeuroTechX Store (work in progress). The devices are the same price or less and NeuroTechX gets money from it. 2 birds 1 stone.</p>

  <p>We are working with our partners to get a discount code for NeuroTechX Student Clubs should be available soon.</p>
