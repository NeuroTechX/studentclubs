<button class="accordion">Do we have to call our student club NeuroTech[something] like most of NeuroTechX initiatives and chapters?</button>
<div class="droppanel"><p>No. We actually discourage you to name your student club with “NeuroTech” in it, as cities Chapters are named NeuroTech[City]. Be original!</p></div>

<button class="accordion">We have our own project we’d like to work on, can we pick our own projects?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
  <p>Of course! The competition has two types of challenges: a fixed and an open challenge. We encourage you to explore what you’d like!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">We are not an “official” student club recognized by our university, can we still be part of NeuroTechX Student Club Initiative and Competitions?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
  <p>Yes! All you need is a written confirmation from your university that we can use the university name and logo when referring to your group.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Wow! I want to join, where do I start?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>Follow the step at the <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/get-started/">Get Started</a> page and reach out to us!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I’m a graduate student, can I participate?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>The competition is for undergraduate students only, but you can still act as a mentor for your university club!</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">I am not a University student (ex: Cegep), can I create a club?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>Unfortunately, the competition is only for university students. Please reach out to us if you want to get involved into creating new types of competition.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Do we need graduate students or professors in our group?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>No, but graduate students and professors may help you getting started.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">There is already a student club at my university, but I don’t like them (or what they work on), can I start another club?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>Yes, however you are strongly encouraged to support your home university’s student club. Please reach out to us if such a need</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">My university doesn’t have “student clubs”, can we still join?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>Yes, you can register as a student group. Make sure your university agrees for you to use its name.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Wouhou, our club is official! What should we focus on now?</button>
<div class="droppanel">
 <p>Now that you found some students to start the club with you, you should start learning about neurotechnologies, BCI and neurosciences. A good starting point is to look at the <a href="/studentclubs/curriculum">curriculum of a NeuroTechX student club</a>. Plenty of resources are available, including examples of projects. The <a href="http://learn.neurotechedu.com/" target="_blank">NeuroTechX Educational website</a> is also our favorite resource for learning the basics of neurotechnologies.</p>
