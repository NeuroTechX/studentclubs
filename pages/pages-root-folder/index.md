# NeuroTechX Student Clubs

Neurotechnology has never been this accessible before. We want to catalyze the interest and involvement of skilled students by providing them with a precise goal to work towards and the resources to get there.

The NeuroTechX Student Club Competition promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, preparing the participants for careers and excellence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through self-learning, knowledge sharing, and practical experimentation.

We believe neurotechnology is key to better understanding and to improving who we are. We aim to inspire a whole new generation of neuroengineers, who will be equipped to drive the field forward.
